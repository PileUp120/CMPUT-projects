Now when he reached the foot of the hill, he turn#aching the harbour, and upon her prow the mariner#, the men of his own land.

And his soul cried ou# to them, and he said:

Sons of my ancient mother# you riders of the tides,

How often have you sai#ed in my dreams. And now you come in my awakening# which is my deeper dream.

Ready am I to go, and#my eagerness with sails full set awaits the wind.#
Only another breath will I breathe in this still#air, only another loving look cast backward,

And#then I shall stand among you, a seafarer among se#farers.

And you, vast sea, sleepless mother,

Wh# alone are peace and freedom to the river and the#stream,

Only another winding will this stream ma#e, only another murmur in this glade,

And then s#all I come to you, a boundless drop to a boundles# ocean.
