A) Starting with the top-left side, there are no groups of 4 nodes that are maximally connected to each other, neither
are there 3 nodes that are maximally connected to each other, hence the cliques will be of size 2 at most, thus,
A abstracts {a,b}
B abstracts {c,d}
C abstracts {e,f}
D abstracts {g}
E abstracts {h,i}
F abstracts {j,k}
G abstracts {l,m}
H abstracts {n}
I abstracts {o,p}
J abstracts {q,r}
K abstracts {s,t}
L abstracts {u}

B) 
i) Let the original graph contain 4^n (4 to the power of n) nodes, if every abstraction level always groups 4 nodes,
then there must be 4^n-1 nodes in the first abstraction level, and every subsequent abstraction level will further
decrease the power of 4 by 1. For example if the original graph has 16 nodes, which is 4^2, then4 groups of 4 nodes
will be made in the next abstraction level which is 4^1. Therefore at the k-th abstraction level there will be 4^n-k
nodes.

ii) As explained in (i), with each abstraction level the power of 4 decreases by 1, there will be exactly 1 node
when the power of 4 is equal to 0, that is, at the n-th abstraction level, there will be only one node.

iii) Given that n=2u, it is implied that u=n/2, which means that u is halfway from reducing the starting graph to
exactly one node. From part (i) at the u-th abstraction level, there will be 4^(n-u), which is 4^(n-n/2), which is
equal to 4^(n/2), or the square root of (4^n) nodes. Thus at abstraction level u, the number of nodes will be the
square root of the original number of nodes.

iv) Given that 
	(1) for two nodes I and J to be connected in clique based abstraction, at least one original node in I must 
be connected to an original node in J, 
	(2) for a group of nodes to be abstracted into one node, all of those nodes are maximally connected to each other.

Suppose the opposite, let there be no path from A' to B', this would mean that none of the original nodes that make
up A' and B', including A and B, are connected to each other, which contradicts that there is a path from A to B.
Considering the case of A and B, if A and B are not connected to each other, then the abstract nodes which will
contain A and B, that is A' and B', will not be connected to each other, which would contradict that A' and B' are
connected to each other.
Therefore there is a path from A to B if and only if there is a path from A' to B', and if there is a path from A to
B, there must be a path from A' to B'.
