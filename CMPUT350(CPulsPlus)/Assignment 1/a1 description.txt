CMPUT 350 Assignment 1
Due Wednesday Sep-29, 22:00

Important: read this text completely and start working on the assignment as
soon as possible. Only then will you get an idea about how long it will take
you to complete it

If you worked on the assignment on your personal computer, copy your files to
the undergraduate lab machine assigned to you (e.g. uf13.cs.ualberta.ca) with
scp and then test your code there as well before submitting it

When done, submit your solution files

   README.txt CPoint.c String.h String.cpp Set.h Set.cpp hexagons.cpp

on eClass

In this assignment you can't use C++ container types or functions from C++
libraries such as STL or Boost. However, you can use standard C libraries

Your submissions will be marked considering their correctness (syntax and
semantics), documentation, efficiency, and consistent coding style. Add assert
statements to check important pre/post-conditions

Finally, make sure that you follow the course collaboration policy which is
stated on the course webpage. File README.txt must be completed

========================================================================

1. [13 marks] Given C++ code Point.cpp, your task is to relive the early C++
days in which only C compilers were available by transforming the C++ code
into equivalent C code - line by line - inspired by the example in the lecture
(Part 2, page 2). Your C++ to C translator that runs in your brain is very
basic - it can't remove useless code. The resulting code stored in CPoint.c
has to compile using

              gcc -Wall -Wextra -O -std=c99 CPoint.c

without errors nor warnings on the lab computers. To simplify marking, put
comments that contain the original C++ lines in front of the C code
implementing them

Note: we are not asking you to write a general C++ to C transformer. Your task
is to convert the given file into C code manually

========================================================================

2. [12 marks] Implement a C++ string class in files String.h and String.cpp
   following the coding style and comment suggestions presented in the
   lecture

Strings are immutable objects, like in Java, i.e., once created, Strings
cannot be changed. This allows us to save memory when copying Strings by
storing character sequences in shared objects that are reference
counted. I.e., whenever a String is created, a shared object is allocated that
contains the character sequence with an initial reference count of 1. Later,
whenever a String gets copied or assigned, the count is incremented and the
new copy just points to the shared object. When Strings are deleted, the
reference count is decremented. Once the count reaches 0, the shared object is
no longer in use and can be destroyed. In the shared objects, strings are
stored as C-strings, i.e., 0-terminated char arrays

You may add private const data members and private methods to the class
definition, but no other members

Your code has to compile using

              g++ -Wall -Wextra -O -std=c++17 ...

without generating errors nor warnings on the lab computers

Make sure your implementation does not leak memory by testing it thoroughly
creating, assigning, copying, and destroying thousands of Strings in
mainString.cpp and running valgrind. You only submit String.* which don't
contain test code

============================================================================

3. [16 marks] Implement a memory efficient set class in files Set.h and
Set.cpp following the coding style and comment suggestions presented in the
lecture

The sets considered here represent subsets of { 0..n-1 } and are implemented
in terms of bit sequences stored in int arrays, where bit i encodes whether
element i is in the set (bit=1) or not (bit=0)

For instance, for n = 4, integer 11 (base 10) = 1011 (base 2) represents the
set {0,1,3} because bit 0,1, and 3 are 1 (read from right to left - lower
order bits are listed first). 2 is not in the set because its corresponding
bit (third lowest) is 0

In general, bit k indicates whether number k is in the set: if the k-th bit is
1, k is in the set. If the k-th bit is 0, k is not in the set

What are the advantages of storing sets like this? High speed and low memory
requirements. As an example consider sets of numbers between 0 and 31. They
can be represented as a single integer value. E.g.

A={ 0, 1, 2, 8, 31 }      <=> 10000000'00000000'00000001'00000111 (base 2)
B={ 8, 17, 30, 31  }      <=> 11000000'00000010'00000001'00000000 
---------------------
A intersect B = { 8, 31 } <=> 10000000'00000000'00000001'00000000

which happens to be the result of a bitwise and operation (& in C++) on the
bit sequences for A and B. Nifty - and quite fast - as such operations only
take a nanosecond or so on modern CPUs!

In this problem, bit sequences will be stored in int arrays with the goal of
using as little memory as possible (1 bit per element)

An int variable can hold a certain number of bits (use static const int
INT_BITS = sizeof(int)*8 in your code). Your code needs to allocate a large
enough int array to store n bits (how many integers do you need exactly?),
with bit i = 1 indicating that element i is contained in the set

Set functions clear(), complement(), add(const Set &s), and remove(const Set
&s) need to be implemented as efficiently as possible, which means that you
can't afford to iterate through all set elements individually

As illustrated above, implement above functions using bitwise integer
operations &, |, and ~ to test, set, and negate individual bits, as well
as bit-shift operations << and >>

E.g. the following test checks whether bit i is set in integer y:

  if ((1 << i) & y) ... ,

(b | c) computes the union of two bit sets encoded as integers b and c,
(b & c) computes the intersection, and 
~b      computes the complement set of b
etc.

Sets are sole owners of their data, i.e., data aren't shared when copying or
assigning sets and therefore have to be allocated and copied

You may add private const data members and private methods to the class
definition, but no other members

Your code has to compile using

              g++ -Wall -Wextra -O -std=c++17 ...

without generating errors nor warnings on the lab machines

Make sure your implementation does not leak memory by testing it
thoroughly. We suggest using valgrind. Also add assertions that ensure that
sets are compatible and elements are within range 0..n-1. See mainSet.cpp for
some examples.

You only submit Set.h and Set.cpp which doesn't contain test code

Note on assert: In C and C++, assertions work as follows:

#include <cassert>
...
assert(i >= 0);   // if i < 0 the program will stop here with an error message

To make your program faster after convincing yourself that it is correct,
checking assertions can be switched off by passing -DNDEBUG to the compiler
