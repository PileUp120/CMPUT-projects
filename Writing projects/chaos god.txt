It would seem like a strom was coming, there were dark clouds covering the sky as far as the eye could see.
However, anyone who thought that it was a simple storm were in for a horrible truth. These clouds were a battleground, the gods were about to got to war.

**locartion change**
Once the children of Lueng village reached the age of 12, they would all partake in a rite of passage known as the Cirtesia. They would be given a small amount of rations, and a week's worth of time
to navigate through the nearby forest which was rumored to have the ghosts of ancient warriors, ferocious beasts and deadly carnivorous vegetation. Of course
children were trained for this their entire lives, taught combat, stealth, using one's surroundings to one's advantage, how to ration supplies and many more
skills.
Afterall, this village was famed for producing armies that could easily acheive decisive victories even when outnumbered fifty to one. The punishment for
failing this trial was severe, all failures would be exiled, only allowed to return once they reached adulthood. If they chose to return, they would only be allowed to live as a farmer.

Dejil was born with a body weaker than most, on top of being physically weaker than children of their age, they were shorter than others, would easily catch colds,
and always fell behind during all lessons except ones where only knowledge was tested. But they would be no exception to the Cirtesia. So when the day came, their parents were
seeing them off with words of encouragement, like all other parents.

On their first day, they spent time gathering supplies to make a campfire and cook food as needed, they also tried to scout their immediate suoorundings to look for any dangerous
beasts or plants that may be around. Thanks to this planning they were able to get well ahead of the other competitors over the next three days and were on track to clear the course
within 5 days instead of 7. However, an unexpected storm swept across the forest that night and Dejil was injured by landslides. Due to the path they were taking, no other contestant came
across them and they had to perforn aid on themselves and practically crawled and dragged themselses to the forest exit. However they arrived a day too late and they were exiled 
from the village. As their parents tearfully saw them off, they hung their head as they walked away from the village. 

Dejil walked for days, their eyes hollow and devoid of life until they finally collapsed near a fruit tree. Lifelessly they picked up the fruits scattered around the tree and began
eating in almost a mechanical fasion.

A few days later, they were approached by a short silhouette of a person. This person wore a long black cloak, a green blindfold covering their eyes, and the rest of their body was covered
in bandages, almost resembling a mummy. It was impossible to tell if this person was a man or a woman, an adult or a child.

"So this is it for you? After all those years of training hardter than anyone else", the person spoke

"..." Dejil slowly turned their head and stared blankly at the figure

"You have cultivated skills that none among your peers have. There is so much you can do, instead of wasting away here."

"...who...are you?"

"Think of me as some kind of social worker, who hates to see such a rare talent waste away because of some misfortune."

"...How do you even know about me? Are you some kind of stalker?"

"Surely you didn't think that a village that produces some of the finest warrios in the laand isn't being monitored by those interested?
All who seek to hire yoour warriors observe the Cirtesiasia every year."

"..."

"This world has gone to Hell as soon as the gods started their foolish war. We have found a place with a strange ability to grant warrios almost godlike powers, the only catch is that
it works only by resurrecting fallen warriors. On top of that it only seems to work on those who have fallen noo more than a week ago."
