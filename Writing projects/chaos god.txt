It would seem like a strom was coming, there were dark clouds covering the sky as far as the eye could see.
However, anyone who thought that it was a simple storm were in for a horrible truth. These clouds were a battleground, the gods were about to got to war.

**several years ago**
Once the children of Lueng village reached the age of 12, they would all partake in a rite of passage known as the Cirtesia. They would be given a small amount of rations, and a week's worth of time
to navigate through the nearby forest which was rumored to have the ghosts of ancient warriors, ferocious beasts and deadly carnivorous vegetation. Of course
children were trained for this their entire lives, taught combat, stealth, using one's surroundings to one's advantage, how to ration supplies and many more
skills. Afterall, this village was famed for producing armies that could easily acheive decisive victories even when outnumbered fifty to one. The punishment for
failing this trial was severe, all failures would be exiled, only allowed to return once they reached adulthood. If they chose to return, they would only be allowed to live as a farmer.

Dejil was born with a body weaker than most, on top of being physically weaker than children of their age, they were shorter than others, would easily catch colds,
and always fell behind during all lessons except ones where only knowledge was tested. But they would be no exception to the Cirtesia. So when the day came, their parents were
seeing them off with words of encouragement, like all other parents.
